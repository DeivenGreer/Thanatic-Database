Most 2D design should be UI design and item sprites. Virtualized items, buildings, and crafting systems deposited into a pocket dimension shall be 2 Dimensional.

**UI:**
The KISS (Keep it Simple Stupid) philosophy shall apply here, as doing everything would be overwhelming. (We want multiple UIs for the same game.) First, develop the first headset GUI, and add compatibility for more to be created. Create palette swaps of the first GUI. The game shall be able to be run without this GUI equipped.

Here are the most necessary features of the beginner UI in order of importance:
- Aiming Reticle
- Health (Could start as a bar, then be a body upon upgrade, then have detail)
- Stamina
- Food, Water, and Sleep
- Hotbars
- Inventory Screen
- Trade Screen
- Weapon Equip and Upgrade Screen (See Dark Cloud gameplay)
- On-hand crafting screen. (Recipes without workbenches, like torches exist.)
- Hover over features. Item, NPC, and Player Identification.

Intermediate Features:
- Dungeon minimap
- Fast Travel map (At first all levels will be randomized until you get rare items to control the dungeon's stability. Will be very rare.)
- Compass
- Workbench Crafting

Advanced UI Features:
- Pinging system for other players/self
- Sound/Decibel level
- Integrated Music Player
- Sound Detection through walls
