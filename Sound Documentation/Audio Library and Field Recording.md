Also known as Foley sound effects, this is actually gathering samples yourself. Since I have a podcasting mic and a small closet, I can do this. I just have to buy a new desktop, so that I can bring my silent laptop with me and record various sounds. Here's a list of recommendations I 'liberated' from Wikipedia:

Common tricks:

    Corn starch in a leather pouch makes the sound of snow crunching.
    A pair of gloves sounds like bird wings flapping.
    An arrow or thin stick makes a whoosh sound.
    An old chair makes a controllable creaking sound.
    A water-soaked rusty hinge when placed against different surfaces makes a creaking sound. Different surfaces change the sound considerably.
    A heavy staple gun combined with other small metal sounds make good gun noises.
    A metal rake makes the rattle/squeak sound of chain-link fence; it can also make a metallic screech when dragged across a piece of metal.
    A heavy car door and fender can create most of the car sounds needed, but having a whole car in the studio is better.
    Burning plastic garbage bags cut into strips makes a realistic sounding candle or soft non-crackling fire when the bag melts and drips to the ground.
    1‚ÅÑ4-inch audio tape balled up sounds like grass or brush when walked upon.
    Gelatin and hand soap make squishing noises.
    Frozen romaine lettuce makes bone or head injury noises.
    Coconut shells cut in half and stuffed with padding make horse hoof noises.
    Cellophane creates crackling fire effects.
    A selection of wooden and metal doors is needed to create all sorts of door noises, but also can be used for creaking boat sounds.
    Acorns, small apples and walnuts on a wooden parquet surface can be used for bones breaking.
    Walnuts are used in place of ice cubes in a glass of water because they do not melt.
    Large and thin metal plates, known as thunder sheets, can be used to produce the sound of thunder when bent and shaken.

This is 3 sounds every 15 minutes. You can set a timer, and set up a list of sounds ahead of time. If you dedicate a day to this, you should have enough for a demo.
