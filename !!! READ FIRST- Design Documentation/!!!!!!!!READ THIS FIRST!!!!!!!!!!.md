Remember: most games fail because they aren't good, or fun. We can easily be better if we enjoy  the process of making stuff. If we make more than 1 game, we beat 75% of developers on steam. If we make more than 150 dollars, we are in the top 4%. If we make demos and work as a team, we are unstoppable. Our first demos will suck. We can make the dream game after we have the ability.

If you would like to contribute to the project, please read the [[Design Document]] so we are better off than Starfield's Devs- don't worry, I made it quick. Next, download Godot and install the game from [[Thanatic Game Updates]]. If you're looking to create resources, you can contribute something physical to the [[2D Asset File Drop]], [[3D Asset File Drop]], and [[Code Asset File Drop]] fields. Always feel free to upload your files to these places on Obsidian and Discord. Do whatever works, and show others how.

Please check the [[Recommended Software List]], To Do lists, and [[Inspiration- Recommended Games and Art]] for creation of assets. When in doubt, make something you enjoy making!
