This is the 80/20 tracker for the game in order to create easy wins for a tech demo to recruit other members. 80% of the progress for 20% of the work. 

To Myself: Speak of this game to no one until you have a product. Develop it every day, even if it's small progress. If you are off a full day, dedicate the day to it. Read this To Do daily when confused. Never close obsidian and make this your primary desktop environment when shutting down for the day.

**80/20:**
- [x] -Establish Master Lists:
	- [x] To Do for Game Sound
	- [x] To Do for Game UI
	- [x] To Do for 3D Environment
	- [x] To Do for 2D Environment
	- [x] Establish Design Document
	- [x] Establish Story Document
	- [ ] Establish a schedule of deadlines for consistent progress
	- [x] Convert an old discord group into Game Dev
- [ ] Accomplish a major goal for each master list each day that is not just writing on Obsidian other than the Design Document (Sanity Check). It needs to be a deliverable, physical product. Check and reset this list daily.
