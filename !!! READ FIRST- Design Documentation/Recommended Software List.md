Everything here is free other than FL Studio, and Obsidian Sync. We can create the entire game for free, other than communication and file sharing through Obsidian. I hope this list helps facilitate that.

**Game Engine:** 
- Unreal 5
- Godot 4 if we decide for some reason to go back to it:
	- Godot 4 FPS Template Open Source Code is being used as the current game framework: https://github.com/chafmere/Godot4-FPS-Template?tab=readme-ov-file
	- This is how we will add multiplayer Integration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8D3vEx7NAE
	- This is how we add NPCs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VasHZZyPpYU
	- This is how we will do the dungeon generation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjuyfBaryu8
	- This is how we will make our first UI: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V79YabQZC1s
	- How we will add new resources to Godot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRZjM9MTGw
	- Every chance I get, I will upload a new update to Obsidian for you to download the files and make your own additions to the game. You can find that here: [[Thanatic Game Updates]]

**Story & Lore:**
- ==Obsidian.== We will have a timeline, storyboards, dialogue trees, and all writing in the game contained within the Story and Lore, and In-Game Dialogue design folders.
- I recommend we only use Obsidian. All tools are here, and we want for nothing. Everyone can access this, when done properly. IF WE GET DESPERATE we can use Microsoft Excel. Spreadsheets are available in Obsidian.
