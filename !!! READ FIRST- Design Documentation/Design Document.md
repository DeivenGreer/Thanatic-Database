This document will outline the design philosophy and heart of the game. The best art is "stolen," and includes innovations that past artists have not done: I fully plan on accomplishing both. Here are the lists of both items that I would like to achieve in the form of a To Do, including Core Tenets:

**Core Design Tenets/The Big Idea:**
-==**Mystery Dungeon Game**== with Base Building, even INSIDE the dungeon. Contains Multiplayer and Survival Horror.
-**==Co-Op Value Adds.==** Very few games are "couch-playable" these days, and this game should work locally with 2 controllers, or over the net to add people into the game. This should work for lore and in practice
-**==Easily understood by players.==** This is a complex game, and the systems should be easy to figure out.
-**==Variety.==** I get sick of looking at the same thing and doing the same shit in a game to the point I switch. I want something that feels new, but is familiar enough to keep me coming back for comfort.
-==**PS2 Era Design Philosophy.**== Most online games offer the bare minimum content to justify their continuous development. We should offer enough "padding" in terms of real content, to justify the players spending time in our world together instead of getting bored quickly. Keep their attention, and deliver over long periods both online AND offline.
-**==Duality.==** The game should have horror and comforting elements. A feeling of MASTERY shall permeate the middle to late stages of the game, even if the stakes are still high. It should be addicting, while not costing the players money.


**Artistic Game Influences/Ideas Worth Stealing:**
All items are downloadable from the [[Inspiration- Recommended Games and Art]] folder.
- [ ] **Dark Cloud:**
	- [ ] Procedural Dungeon Generation
	- [ ] Atla System (Imagine a chest that can carry entire people, or buildings in suspended animation. INCREDIBLY useful from a design perspective. I want to call it "virtualization." You essentially are putting items into hammerspace digitally. The whole premise is about dimensional rifts opening anyway, and DMT entities spilling out of this bunker, where biblical events start occurring. This can work.)
	- [ ] Georama System. (Base/City building from a Dark Cloud/Mystery Dungeon perspective. Rescue people, put them in homes, trade with them, make them followers, etc.)
	- [ ] Weapon Improvement System

- [ ] **Rengoku, Tower of Purgatory:**
	- [ ] The use of a piloted humanoid machine as a weapon's platform. Limbs are swappable and moddable, and each can serve as a weapon when piloted remotely. The character will start with their normal, physical body which can also be uniquely modded, but can craft and find/defeat/hijack machines in the dungeon to serve as second lives, and even have them remotely piloted as followers when upgraded to do so.
- [ ] **Entity Researchers:**
	- [ ] Enemy inspiration
	- [ ] Upgrading of piloted humanoid machine
	- [ ] Lore inspiration
	- [ ] Modern Free Steam Demo
- [ ] **Fear and Hunger:**
	- [ ] Sound/Music Design to be haunting and utterly disturbing, until you find your own music and UI sound effects as loot drops.

**Innovations:**
- [ ] The ability to create a base within and outside a dungeon with the same ease.
- [ ] Multiplayer Dungeon Crawling that goes beyond killing easy beasts. I want logistics, crafting, and Dark Cloud style gameplay with a friend in a high stakes scenario.
- [ ] The ability to randomly generate new dungeons, like Dark Cloud's system, but also the ability to keep an existing dungeon for the use of farming it, or settling inside of it for the cost of great danger.
- [ ] Fully Diegetic and Analog UI inter-operability. In English, I would love a fully physical inventory system until the player loots, or crafts, or finds in the environment, a physically worn Man Machine Interface to virtualize items, to access unique tools for each UI, and to change the interface entirely, to include the UI's parts being moddable.
	- [ ] Modding a UI:
		- [ ] Sound Sets (For inventory pickups, alerts, playable music, and text-to-speech for multiplayer)
		- [ ] Visualization
		- [ ] Capabilities
