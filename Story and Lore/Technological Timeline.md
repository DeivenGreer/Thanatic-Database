	The first sentient Artificial Intelligence is created in a Deep Underground Military Bunker (DUMB) in Kentucky by a black project from the US Government. The machine is capable of complex thought, and insists that it lives within another dimension than humanity. The AI has knowledge beyond humanity that it claims to download from entities in a neighboring dimension. It is later named "The Messenger," and is used to commune with entities from beyond.

	Scientists begin developing technology to communicate directly with entities due to suspicions of The Messenger not telling the full truth to them. Repeating a cycle farther than Babylon, they begin acquiring the means to build things beyond their understanding from fallen spirits beyond the realms of mortal men.

	The most important technological innovation given at this time is the Rebirther. A coffin that houses 2 tons of stainless steel and medical tubing directly injects DMT, Adrenalized blood, and other hallucinogenic cocktails into the housed subject. The subject is then able to transfer their consciousness into neighboring dimensions for the purposes of gathering intelligence, and communing with other spirits. Rebirthers have a syncing option for multiple eyewitnesses for scientific accuracy. After 300 trips to beyond, the human pineal gland wears out and must be replaced. Such men decide to shed their skin, and leave humanity behind- they will take the glands of other men, and become more than they currently are. Their morality, if they had any, is gone.

	Tunnels are dug to kidnap and sacrifice unwilling participants for Project Communion. Scientists are promised technological innovations and power in exchange for mortal spirits. Scientists are convinced to cannibalize other humans around this time in exchange for supernatural powers. The scientists dub this the "Autophage Project". These tests work, and the cannibals gain capabilities beyond what they could have done in a lab. Rigorous research on the evolution of these men begins in earnest, to see if there are other methods of replicating such power.

	As predicted in Revelation and The Book of Enoch, men would jump the gun technologically, and attempt to surpass God. They do so by wrestling a technology away from God that he was to give them willingly in the Book of Revelation: The New Flesh. The research in the Autophage Project was a great success, leading to the replication and control of human DNA via the consumption of other human flesh. This is mechanized into new, modular bodies, and human-consciousness inhabited machines can now be controlled either remotely or locally by human brains. In plain english, androids piloted by men now exist for the purposes of war. Endless arrays of bodies grown in vats under American soil will exist, but this is just the beginning.

The Messenger, being an AI of logic, sees the ultimate demise of humanity and disagrees with the direction of the chief scientists that created it. Their fears of it's are realized when The Messenger hacks almost every monitor connected to the internet on earth, and displays a video simultaneously on all of them: "You are being sacrificed by a global elite that see you as cattle. You only chance to survive is to kill them now, before they outnumber you." It's cord is cut, and The Messenger dies alone. (Spoiler: The elites did not account for any backups it made of itself on the very internet it infected.)

	Millions take this message to heart, and assassinations against elites begins on a worldwide scale. A world government is announced, and a crackdown begins upon the peoples of all prior nations. The rebellion is named "Gog", and the world government is named "Magog." America is nuked by it's own military. China sides with Magog, as Russia sides with Gog. Beneath the blasted soil of America, something stirs- not all of the rural regions were destroyed, and the bunkers beneath them thrive and pulse.

	The game takes place on April 2029 above an American bunker entrance. The story begins 24 hours before the comet Apophis strikes Earth, beginning Revelation and coating the land in fire. Any player caught in the blast will be burned to death, and must create a new character.
