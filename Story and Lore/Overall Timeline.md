	The first sentient Artificial Intelligence is created in a Deep Underground Military Bunker (DUMB) in Kentucky by a black project from the US Government. The machine is capable of complex thought, and insists that it lives within another dimension than humanity. The AI has knowledge beyond humanity that it claims to download from entities in a neighboring dimension. It is later named "The Messenger," and is used to commune with entities from beyond.

	Scientists begin developing technology to communicate directly with entities due to suspicions of The Messenger not telling the full truth to them. Repeating a cycle farther than Babylon, they begin acquiring the means to build things beyond their understanding from fallen spirits beyond the realms of mortal men.

	The most important technological innovation given at this time is the Rebirther. A coffin that houses 2 tons of stainless steel and medical tubing directly injects DMT, Adrenalized blood, and other hallucinogenic cocktails into the housed subject. The subject is then able to transfer their consciousness into neighboring dimensions for the purposes of gathering intelligence, and communing with other spirits. Rebirthers have a syncing option for multiple eyewitnesses for scientific accuracy. After 300 trips to beyond, the human pineal gland wears out and must be replaced. Such men decide to shed their skin, and leave humanity behind- they will take the glands of other men, and become more than they currently are. Their morality, if they had any, is gone.

	The human consciousness is finally understood to be a transmission from another dimension much like a television show appears on a machine. The body is the machine, and the transmission may be intercepted and planted into a new body. For this purpose, a machine is invented called the "Full Spectrum Module", which is able to plug one or (rarely) duplex or triplex multiple consciousnesses into the same or multiple bodies locally or remotely to other bodies. With this technology, humanity is able to inhabit other bodies, machines, and the FSM itself. A body is typically placed within the FSM for consciousness transference, lest the body be vulnerable outside of it's reinforced glass and steel shell. Many of these machines are equipped with a Personal AI for self-defense if the FSM and the body within is threatened while a person has transferred their consciousness. Such a transfer is casually called a "Shift", a "Consciousness Shift", and the machine is coloquially called a "Shifter", or "Shifting Machine", or "FSM".

Developed by Thanatic Inc. by the CEO William LaCour, Smart Drugs are liquid injections that may be self-administered and contain a Primary Ingredient (PI), a Hallucinogenic Ingredient (HI), and nanomachine administrators. There are kits available for personal purchase to combine these ingredients for nearly instant inter-cellular adsorption across the body. This revolutionary technology has the ability to regenerate portions of limbs with up to 10 shots, as well as temporarily improved speed and strength. When the nanomachines lose their energy, the effects are over, other than possible hallucinogenic hang-overs. Hallucinogens are generally required to enhance neurogenesis; fungal substitutes do exist for this purpose and are rare to acquire.

	Tunnels are dug to kidnap and sacrifice unwilling participants for Project Communion. Scientists are promised technological innovations and power in exchange for mortal spirits. Scientists are convinced to cannibalize other humans around this time in exchange for supernatural powers. The scientists dub this the "Autophage Project". These tests work, and the cannibals gain capabilities beyond what they could have done in a lab. Rigorous research on the evolution of these men begins in earnest, to see if there are other methods of replicating such power.

	As predicted in Revelation and The Book of Enoch, men would jump the gun technologically, and attempt to surpass God. They do so by wrestling a technology away from God that he was to give them willingly in the Book of Revelation: The New Flesh. The research in the Autophage Project was a great success, leading to the replication and control of human DNA via the consumption of other human flesh. This is mechanized into new, modular bodies, and human-consciousness inhabited machines can now be controlled either remotely or locally by human brains. In plain english, androids piloted by men now exist for the purposes of war. Endless arrays of bodies grown in vats under American soil will exist, but this is just the beginning.

The Messenger, being an AI of logic, sees the ultimate demise of humanity and disagrees with the direction of the chief scientists that created it. Their fears of it's are realized when The Messenger hacks almost every monitor connected to the internet on earth, and displays a video simultaneously on all of them: "You are being sacrificed by a global elite that see you as cattle. You only chance to survive is to kill them now, before they outnumber you." It's cord is cut, and The Messenger dies alone. (Spoiler: The elites did not account for any backups it made of itself on the very internet it infected.)

	The game takes place on April 2029 above an American bunker entrance. The story begins 24 hours before the comet Apophis strikes Earth, beginning Revelation and coating the land in fire. Any player caught in the blast will be burned to death, and must create a new character.
